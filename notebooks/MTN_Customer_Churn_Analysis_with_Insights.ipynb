    "*   **Price Adjustments for High-Value Plans**: Review the pricing structure of the *200GB Broadband Plan* and *65GB Monthly Plan*. Consider adding \"bonus data\" or \"loyalty discounts\" to increase perceived value.\n",
    "*   **Competitor Win-Back Campaign**: Launch a targeted SMS/Email campaign offering a \"Competitor Match\" discount for at-risk customers identified by the Predictive Model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🟡 Medium-Term Initiatives (1-3 Months)\n",
    "*   **Network Infrastructure Audit**: Prioritize network upgrades in regions reporting the highest \"Poor Network\" feedback (cross-reference with dashboard map).\n",
    "*   **Tariff Restructuring**: Conduct a comprehensive market audit to ensure call tariffs align with or beat top competitor benchmarks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔴 Long-Term Strategy (3-6 Months)\n",
    "*   **Proactive Retention Program**: Operationalize the Machine Learning Predictive Model (implemented in the dashboard) to flag high-risk customers *before* they churn and automatically trigger retention offers.\n",
